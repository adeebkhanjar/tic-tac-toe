#tic tac toe with react
We built a tic-tac-toe game with react hooks
each player will take turns playing switching between "x"and"o" each turn
thae tile clicked on will display the letter representing the player either 'x' or 'o'
beneath the game tiles the players turn will be displayed and changed after each turn
if a player manages to fill a full LINE of consecutive tiles either diagonally or horizontally or vertically the player wins and it will display beneath the game tiles
if all of the game tiles get filled and there was no winner a draw will be displayed beneath the game tiles
on the left side beaneath the game tiles a history part is located that will render a button for each state of the game ,these button will allow us revert back to previus states when clicked
